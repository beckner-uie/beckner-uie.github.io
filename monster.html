      <h3>Bokoblins</h3>
      <p class="description">
        Bokoblins and thier ilk are some of the most commonly found enemies
        across Hyrule. They come in a wide variety of colors, skills, and levels
        of intelligence. The one universal feature they all share is a complete
        and utter hatred for Hylians.

      <h3>Moblins</h3>
      <p class="description">
        Moblins once competed with Hylians for the dominance of Hyrule. Endless
        battles were fought between the two, but eventually the Hylians
        prevailed. Some say Demise punished the Moblin race for this failure by
        stealing thier wisdom, turning them into a race of near-mindless brutes.

      <h3>Lizalfos</h3>
      <p class="description">
        These chameleon-like creatures dominate most of Hyrule's waterways. They
        live in small tribes and live by hunting fish and crafting wares from
        driftwood and fish bone. They are fast and cunning creatures, and
        despise Zora because they claim territory they feel belongs to them.

      <h3>Stalfos</h3>
      <p class="description">
        The undead skeletons of Demise's spawn rise at night to attack any
        travellers they find, to little other end than mindless killing. Many
        believe that Demise is so obsessed with world-domination that he will
        not let his soliders sleep even in death.

      <h3>Poe</h3>
      <p class="description">
        While an undead being like Stalfos, a Poe is vastly different. Poe are
        intelligent, mischievous, and greedy, and have the unique ability to be
        able to shift between realms. Poe can't be killed, but if thier soul
        becomes trapped they cannot return to thier full self until freed.
