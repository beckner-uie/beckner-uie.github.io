          There are two immensely popular gaming systems known around the world:
          the Legend of Zelda video game series, and the tabletop roleplaying
          system Dungeons and Dragons. Both have been popular enough to warrant
          thier own market deviations in the form of movies, books, and fan
          merchandise. It comes at no surprise that the two fanbases of these
          games often overlap, which leads to many fun and interesting
          creations. I aim to add to that gallery of fan-made creations with one
          of my own; A Dungeons and Dragons based roleplaying system designed
          for the world of Legend of Zelda.

          If you look for a Dungeons and Dragons ruleset for the Legend of Zelda
          series, you will find there are an overwhelming number of them. But
          the two games, each having been actively making new content for over
          two decades, have no shortage of material of which to convert and
          infinite possiblities of interpretation and design. I am choosing to
          focus on two specific eras within the games history: The 4th edition
          rules set for Dungeons and Dragons, and the Twilight Princess game
          from Legend of Zelda. My hope is to create a fun, engaging, and
          balanced system that allows any fan of either game to fully immerse
          themselves in the worlds of fantasy just as both series of games have
          done for years.
